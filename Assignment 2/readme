This is an IntelliJ project in which I have all my assignment one questions done in. All of the reflections are done as
inline comments and descriptions of classes at the top of the public classes I've made. I made a public class for each
question I answered that should correspond to the question in the assignment.
Here is a map of where my assignment answers are:
Question 1: Q1BT (test cases and code)
Question 2: A2Q2 (test cases), Q2SearchTree (code)
Question 3: uploaded as a separate file and image in folder
Question 4: A2Q4 (test case), Q4HT (code)
Question 5: Q5 (test cases and code)
